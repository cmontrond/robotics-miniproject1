# Robotics Mini-Project 1

First Mini-Project for COMP 570: Robotics at Bridgewater State University.<br>

This project aims to create a robot, and a program that will find a light and drive to the light.
By doing this project, the student will gain experience doing sensor/effector fusion, using sensor data to drive behavior 
in its simplest form.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local robot for development 
and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

* GoPiGo3 Kit;
* Two Light Sensors;
* Have Go Installed;
